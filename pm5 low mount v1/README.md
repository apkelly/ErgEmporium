# PM5 mount low mount v1

This project moves the PM5 monitor to a lower position on the Concept 2 rower, a perfect companion to the VESA monitor mount, allowing you to still see your stats while enjoing your favourite Netflix or Disney+ shows.

## Installation

### Step 1 -  the PM5 monitor.

The back of the PM5 monitor is secured by 4 external screws, and 2 internal (inside the battery cover) screws. 

Remove all these screws and gently remove the back cover of the PM5 monitor, this will reveal the internal circuit board, be very gentle with this, as the ribbon cable for the display is very delicate.

Take the new PM5 rear cover and using the 4 external screws from earlier attach and secure this new backplate.

### Step 2 - the PM5 monitor mount.

The monitor mount is secured to the side of the main vertical shaft, that previously held the PM5 monitor arm.

With your Concept 2 rower you should have received a screwdriver for assembly, use this screwdriver to remove the 2 upper screws on the shaft (on the opposire side to the flywheel)

Insert the nuts from these 2 screws into the side holes on the monitor mount, we're going to re-insert these screws back into their original holes, but backwards, screwing from the inside outwards.

Once the monitor mount is secured to the side of your rower, the PM5 monitor with new backplate should slide into the groove running down the length of the mount (note: initially this may be stiff, this is on purpose, start slowly and use a method where you insert and remove the mount multiple times, going deeper each time).

Once the PM5 is secured to the side of your rower you can re-attach the sensor cable.

## Notes

With this solution the battery pack supplied with the PM5 is removed, this means you'll need to connect a USB-B cable to the back of the PM5 for power. USB-B is most commonly used with printers, so you're likely to have one of these lying around the house. If you remove power then you'll need to enter the date/time each time you reconnect.

My [PM5 low mount v2](/pm5%20low%20mount%20v2) includes a rechargable battery component that is smaller and lighter than the 2xLR20 batteries used, and means the date/time won't be lost between usages, and also means you can run the rower without the need for a USB-B cable.
