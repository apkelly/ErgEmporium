# Chain lubricator tool v1

This tool is useful when it comes time to lubricate your Concept 2 rowser chain. 

If you attempt this solo it can be tricky to hold the chain while applying the lubricating oil. This tool hooks over the end of the rower and will hold the chain handle securly in place while to apply the oil, allowing you to perform this operation single-handidly.

Simply slip the 2 feet around the rear of the rower, above the rear feet, then slip the silver U shaped bold in the handle over the tool's handle.
