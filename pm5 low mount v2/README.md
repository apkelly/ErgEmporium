# PM5 mount low mount v2

This project moves the PM5 monitor to a lower position on the Concept 2 rower, a perfect companion to the VESA monitor mount, allowing you to still see your stats while enjoing your favourite Netflix or Disney+ shows.

## Installation

### Step 1 -  the PM5 monitor.

The battery cover on the PM5 is held in place with a single screw.

Remove this screw and pull away the battery cover, keep this in a safe place.

Use the new battery cover with in-built sliding joint, it affixes to the back of the PM5 replacing the battery cover you just removed, and reuses the battery screw supplied with the PM5.

### Step 2 - the PM5 monitor mount.

The monitor mount is secured to the side of the main vertical shaft, that previously held the PM5 monitor arm.

With your Concept 2 rower you should have received a screwdriver for assembly, use this screwdriver to remove the 2 upper screws on the shaft (on the opposire side to the flywheel)

Insert the nuts from these 2 screws into the side holes on the monitor mount, we're going to re-insert these screws back into their original holes, but backwards, screwing from the inside outwards.

Once the monitor mount is secured to the side of your rower, the PM5 monitor with new battery cover should slide into the groove running down the length of the mount (note: initially this may be stiff, this is on purpose, start slowly and use a method where you insert and remove the mount multiple times, going deeper each time).

Once the PM5 is secured to the side of your rower you can re-attach the sensor cable.
