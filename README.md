# Concept 2 Rower Experiments, hacks and upgrades

The project below are my experiments and upgrades to my personal Concept 2 Rower, if you want to perform these same upgrades
you'll need access to a 3D printer and some basic tools such as a screwdriver or an adjustable wrench to remove some of the 
bolts on the rower.

Unless noted, all these sub-projects are non-destructive to your Concept 2 Rower, any installation if done carefully can be reversed
and you rower returned to its original factory condition.

Where additional parts are needed I'll aim to include sizes and costs etc.

## VESA mount for computer monitor v1
This project replaces the PM5 mounting arm with an arm that allows you to mount a computer monitor using a standard 100mm VESA mount.
With this replacement you can then use any input source your monitor supports e.g. Chromecast via HDMI, to watch any content you want
while doing your workout.

I've tested this arm with a 24" LG monitor and it supports the weight without issue. A larger monitor may need a longer arm to clear the 
Concept 2 rowing chain, and possible, and may also need increased strength. If you're attempting to use a larger monitor please let me know.

Note, that with this project the PM5 is removed completly. It can still be attached, but if won't be supported in any way. See the
next project for a mounting solution that lets you continue to use the PM5 with the VESA mounted monitor.
