# Concept 2 Rower Experiments, hacks and upgrades

The projects below are my experiments and upgrades to my personal Concept 2 Rower, if you want to perform these same upgrades
you'll need access to a 3D printer and some basic tools such as a screwdriver or an adjustable wrench to remove some of the 
bolts on the rower.

Unless noted, all these sub-projects are non-destructive to your Concept 2 Rower, any installation if done carefully can be reversed
and you rower returned to its original factory condition.

Where additional parts are needed I'll aim to include sizes and costs etc.
