# Concept 2 Rower Experiments, hacks and upgrades

The projects below are my experiments and upgrades to my personal Concept 2 Rower, if you want to perform these same upgrades
you'll need access to a 3D printer and some basic tools such as a screwdriver or an adjustable wrench to remove some of the 
bolts on the rower.

Unless noted, all these sub-projects are non-destructive to your Concept 2 Rower, any installation if done carefully can be reversed
and you rower returned to its original factory condition.

Where additional parts are needed I'll aim to include sizes and costs etc.

# Risk
I've made every attempt to make sure these components are strong, safe, reversible etc. I provide no warranty though, if you decide to attempt to install these you do so at your own risk.
I won't be held liable for any breakages, scratches or damage to your Concept 2 rower, PM5 monitor, your computer monitor/TV, or yourself from following these instructions. 

I wish you well, and I hope you find these enhancements useful, I've tested everything on my own personal Concept 2 Model D rower. If you're not comfortable taking apart electronics, or using an adjustable wrench and screwdriver, then please ask for assistance or reconsider your usage of these files.
