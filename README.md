## VESA mount for computer monitor v1
This project replaces the PM5 mounting arm with an arm that allows you to mount a computer monitor using a standard 100mm VESA mount.
With this replacement you can then use any input source your monitor supports e.g. Chromecast via HDMI, to watch any content you want
while doing your workout.

Note, that with this project alone, the PM5 is removed completly. It can still be attached, but if won't be supported in any way. See the
next project for a mounting solution that lets you continue to use the PM5 with the VESA mounted monitor.
